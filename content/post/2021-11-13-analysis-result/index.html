<h1>Analysis on Lending data of Australia</h1>
<div id="background" class="section level3">
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Based on data disclosed by <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/5601.0Main+Features1Dec%202018?OpenDocument=">Australia Bureau of Statistics</a>, in 2018, lending to household has reached a lowest point since 2015 and lending to commercial kept on fluctuating during 2015 to 2018.</p>
<p>Lending to household, or lending to individual provides a general estimation on citizenâ€™s willingness on consumption. With a sharp decrease on household lending, there should be a clear trend on national consumption willingness.</p>
<p>On the other hand, lending to commercial provides a view on the macro economics.</p>
<p>In this analysis, we try to understand the trend of lending volume in 2018 to generate some insignt on the macro economics.</p>

<h3>Data Preparation</h3>
<p>Data source of this analysis comes from <a href="https://stat.data.abs.gov.au//Index.aspx?QueryId=386">Australia Bureau of Statistics</a>. This contains the value of commitment of 59 types of Loan Purpose under 4 main Categories are contained. Below table<a href="#tab:head">1</a> shows a partial list of the loan purpose.</p>

Usually, lending is splitting into personal loan and commercial loan. In this case, we use a pie chart to see the distribution of each of the loan types. From the below chart<a href="#fig:type">1</a>, we can clearly see that, Commercial Financing and Personal Financing took up most of percentile. This supports the assumption we have at the beginning of this section.

<div id="general-understanding" class="section level3">
<h3>General Understanding</h3>
<p>Although we have a general view that Personal loan kept on decreasing since 2015, while Commercial Financing is fluctuating, we need a deeper understanding on how loan commitment behaved in 2018. Here we first generate a line chart for the total commitment<a href="#fig:smooth">2</a>, and followed with a combine line chart of separate types of loans<a href="#fig:two">3</a>.</p>

<p>As a result, we can still clearly see the trend. For personal loan, the value keep on decreasing during the 11 months, while commercial loan increase and fluctuating.</p>

<div id="relationship-with-economic-estimators" class="section level3">
<h3>Relationship with Economic Estimators</h3>
<p>The main purpose of this analysis is to understand the relationship between loan commitment and some economic estimators.</p>
<p>As Australia government only disclosed <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/price-indexes-and-inflation/consumer-price-index-australia/sep-2021">CPI (Consumer Price Inflation)</a> estimator every three months, it would not be easy to compare CPI with personal loan commitment in one plot.</p>
<p>From graph below<a href="#fig:cpi">4</a>, we can see a significant decline during 2018, which fits the decrease of Personal Loan commitment.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In conclusion, personal loan commitment is a way to reflect the Consumer Price Inflaction. These two estimators are highly correlated and shows the trend of citizen consumption level.</p>
